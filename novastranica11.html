     <p>The history of coffee dates back to the mid-15th century and is very turbulent. In the beginning, it was used in religious rituals in Yemen, while during the 17th century in the Ottoman Turkish Empire, it was not used for political reasons (although this is not well supported by evidence).</p>
 <p>The first coffee shop in Vienna was opened by a Serb named Franjo Đura Kolčić, who seized large quantities of coffee after the Turkish siege of Vienna and started selling it to Viennese ladies. They embraced it as a fantastic invigorating beverage. And then, following their example, other European countries also embraced coffee. Throughout its journey across centuries, coffee has become established on all continents.</p>
 <p>Coffee has always played an extremely important role in the social, cultural, and hedonistic aspects of every society. In Serbia, coffee is enjoyed for pleasant conversations, gossiping, and taking a break from work. Rest and relaxation go hand in hand with this black beverage. Many people started drinking coffee out of "childish joy" - fortune-telling by looking into the cup. Turkish coffee grounds, when the cup is turned upside down, bring messages, and much is expected from them. We bring coffee as a gift when visiting someone, and we never run out of it when expecting guests. It is offered first, and sometimes it can serve as a drink to bid farewell to guests. In our country, coffee has also been known as "sikteruša" since ancient times.</p>
 <p>Coffee is significant not only among Serbs but throughout the world. In Japan, it is gaining more prominence over tea, and October 1st is officially recognized and celebrated as Coffee Day in the Land of the Rising Sun. (Interestingly, unlike Japan, Turks have turned to teas, and they hardly drink "Turkish coffee" anymore.)</p>
 <p>Although it is a prevalent opinion that a lot of coffee is consumed in our country and that we are generally a nation that heavily consumes this beverage, the statistics refute us, as Serbia is not among the top 70 countries in terms of annual coffee consumption per capita.</p>
