    <p>Coffee is prepared in different ways, and the method varies from country to country. The most famous ones are Turkish coffee (or now known as domestic or black coffee in the Balkans), filtered coffee, espresso, instant coffee, and Irish coffee.</p>
<p>There are many variations. For example, Turkish coffee can be boiled or roasted, filtered coffee can have more or less water, espresso can be enhanced to create macchiato, long espresso, caffe latte, cappuccino, instant coffee can have different flavors, and Irish coffee boasts the addition of alcohol.</p>
<p>What is common in recent years for coffee is that each of these types can also be caffeine-free, which is the basic ingredient.</p>
<p>Even the aroma that spreads through the house when someone brews coffee is enough to wake you up. And the first sip! For many, there is nothing more beautiful than waking up to coffee. The "first morning" coffee is important for a good start to the day, and at work, as soon as your head starts to droop, it's time for coffee.</p>
<p>Coffee is prepared by brewing roasted coffee plant seeds, usually in water or milk. It is mostly served hot but also has cold variations.</p>
<p>The coffee plant is most widespread in the equatorial regions of South America, South Asia, India, and Africa. It is cultivated in more than 70 countries and is one of the most important export products of those countries. The two most sought-after types are Arabica and Robusta.</p>
